# React + Vite + Vercel (Free)

Minimal React app created with Vite and ready for free static hosting on Vercel.

## Local Dev
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

The production files are in `dist/`.

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Push this folder to a Git repo (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
2. In Vercel, "New Project" â†’ Import your repo.
3. Framework Preset: **Vite** (auto-detected).
4. Build Command: `vite build` (default `npm run build`).
